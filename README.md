# Aim: To study Inheritance in C++

## Theory: 

Inheritance is one of the fundamental features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++.
It allows a class (called the derived class) to acquire the properties and behaviors (data members and member functions) of another class (called the base class). This promotes code reusability, extensibility, and better organization of programs.

The class that inherits is called the derived class, and the class being inherited from is called the base class.

Advantages of Inheritance:

- Promotes code reusability by avoiding rewriting of common code.

- Helps in building a clear hierarchical relationship between classes.

- Provides a way to extend existing classes without modifying them.
